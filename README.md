Voice-Controlled IoT Digital Twin
A Full-Stack Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Simulation Framework

Project Overview
This project serves as a Digital Twin for a voice-activated IoT device. It simulates the complete signal chain of a modern smart device—from audio stimulus generation to hardware actuation—completely in software.

Designed to demonstrate Automated Embedded Testing capabilities, this framework decouples hardware dependencies, allowing for scalable CI/CD integration while maintaining real-world fidelity through hardware abstraction layers (HAL).
